simple-brick-demo
=================

A really simple Firefox OS app using Brick components. Originally generated for a Firefox OS Workshop in Porto Alegre, later modified to be a bit nicer for JSConf Colombia.

Inside you'll see Brick pre-fab widgets in action, as well as a barebones example of a custom element registered. The custom element grabs random pictures of cats, a very practical real-world problem
